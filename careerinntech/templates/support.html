                <h3>Is the AI interviewer realistic?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. Our AI interviewer simulates real interview environments,
                    asks role-based questions, evaluates responses, and provides
                    actionable improvement feedback.

                    Yes. Questions are designed using actual interview patterns,
                    difficulty levels, and role-specific requirements observed
                    in real hiring processes.
