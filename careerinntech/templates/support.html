                <h4>Is CareerInnTech content real or AI-generated?</h4>
                <p>
                    CareerInnTech follows a hybrid model. Our content is built using real job roles,
                    current hiring trends, and interview patterns, then structured and personalized using AI.
                    AI helps with scalability and personalization, while industry logic ensures accuracy.

                <h4>How do you verify your career roadmaps?</h4>
                <p>
                    Each roadmap is created by analyzing real job descriptions, required skills
                    from hiring platforms, and industry interview expectations. Roadmaps are reviewed
                    and updated regularly to stay relevant.

                <h4>Is this content copied from YouTube or blogs?</h4>
                <p>
                    No. CareerInnTech roadmaps are original and structured from fragmented industry data,
                    then simplified for students. We focus on clarity and execution, not random theory.

                <h4>Is the AI interviewer real?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes. Our AI interviewer simulates real interview environments, asks role-based questions,
